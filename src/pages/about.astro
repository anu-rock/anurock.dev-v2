			<strong>tl;dr</strong>
			I am <a class="cactus-link" href="https://anuragbhandari.com">Anurag Bhandari</a>. I am a <strong
				>generalist software engineer</strong
			>. From services to startup to research to consulting to product, I've been collecting and
			applying my skills diversely. I've also authored <a
				href="https://anuragbhandari.com/books/"
				class="cactus-link">two books</a
			> on programming. I started my "enterprise" journey with .NET, switched over to JavaScript, and
			worked with PHP, Java, and Python at various points. As a generalist, I believe in being adaptable
			and focusing on learning the right things at the right time. This philosophy has allowed me to
			work across various domains and technologies successfully.

			<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">What's AnuRock.dev?</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				It is a platform where I share my expertise, insights, and experiences as a software
				engineer. The goal is to help fellow developers enhance their productivity, learn effective
				methods, and grow in their careers.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				This website serves as <strong>my digital garden</strong> where I cultivate ideas, share educational
				content, and connect with the developer community.

			<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Humble beginnings</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I have been creating software professionally for more than 15 years. But my development
				journey goes back at least four more years.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				The first software I wrote was, if memory serves me well, a website I created for my dad's
				business in 2005, the year I started college. I hosted it on a free subdomain/webspace I had <em
					>earned</em
				> as an active member of a community forum.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				What got me really hooked to web development was KDE's gallery generator (built into its
				file explorer) that took in a bunch of selected image files and spit out a beautiful HTML
				file complete with the necessary <strong>CSS and JavaScript</strong>. The unlikliest of
				sources of inspiration, I know. But CSS and JS were a game changer for me.

			<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">I am a generalist</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I've worked with a good deal of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. I am
				easily excited and find it difficult to resist the urge to try new technologies.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				During my college days, I started a <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_Linux">Linux distribution</a
				> to channel my overflowing enthusiasm for open-source. But mostly to go deeper in computer operating
				systems. Other than OSes, that experience taught me a hell lot about DevOps, PHP, and, importantly,
				solopreneurship.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I started my career as a <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</a
				> developer cranking out Microsoft Office add-ins and ASP.NET websites. My love for open-source
				soon saw me spearhead <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a
				> and <a class="cactus-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> projects in a very
				.NET environment (a proprietary walled garden back then). These were the languages I was more
				comfortable in, stuff I had picked up during my student days. At the dawn of full-stack JavaScript,
				I fully embraced JS as a first-class programming language and became its advocate.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				When <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_(mobile_app_framework)">Ionic Framework</a
				> was still in its infancy, I was spinning out mobile apps for internal clients. Migrating a
				fully-functional web app from <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">AngularJS</a
				> to <a class="cactus-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)"
					>Angular</a
				> 2 (beta) was an adventure of a lifetime! Less than a year after React was publicly released,
				with a state management pattern called Flux, I was teaching a class full of college graduates
				to build an enterprise CRM end-to-end in JS (React + Node.js).
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)">Flutter</a> fan early on
				and established a center of excellence at a large digital consulting firm to promote it as a
				viable mobile SDK. This website was first created as a weekend project in <a
					class="cactus-link"
					href="https://astro.build">Astro</a
				> the day it turned v1.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				All that to say my profession is <strong>not defined by a particular</strong> language or tech
				stack.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="mb-8">
			<h2 class="mb-6 text-xl font-bold">My software development philosophy</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				I subscribe to the <a
					href="https://anuragbhandari.com/coding-tech/jack-of-all-trades-1993/"
					class="cactus-link">jack of all trades</a
				> (and master of [n]one) philosophy. Some people call it the T-shaped profile. I strongly believe
				that to succeed in the ever-changing tech landscape of today, a software developer must constantly
				learn and unlearn skills as demanded by work at hand.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Languages and frameworks are spanners and pliers in an ever-evolving toolkit. There's no
				point tying your self-worth to a specific tool. Let that sink in.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				My mantra to learn rapidly and effectively is to master the 20% of a skill that will account
				for 80% of my application's codebase (<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"
					class="cactus-link">Pareto Principle</a
				>).
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				By applying the <strong>20% method of learning</strong>, I can be productive in any skill in
				less than a week. Time gained by focusing on fewer (but important) concepts allows me to
				jump into development early. Mastering best practices takes time, so I remain consciously
				curious about aspects like performance, security, and automated testing from day 1.
			</p>
			<p>
				This approach has enabled me to quickly adapt to new technologies and projects throughout my
				career, making me effective across different domains.

			<h2 class="mb-6 text-xl font-bold">The key lesson of software engineering</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">Software engineering is much bigger and harder than coding.</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Wait! Aren't coding, programming, development, and engineering one and the same? They are
				not.

			<blockquote class="mb-4 border-l-2 text-center italic">
				Software engineering is programming integrated over time. If you accept this distinction, it
				also becomes clear that we might need to delineate between programming tasks (development)
				and software engineering tasks (development, modificiation, maintenance). - <a

			<h3 class="mb-6 font-bold">What does it mean for you as a software developer?</h3>
			<p class="mb-4">
				It means that writing code is just the first step toward creating a software that works.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				To create a software that will work for years to come, it‚Äôs imperitive to widen your view of
				engineering to encompass other equally important aspects like automated tests, code reviews,
				version control, code style, and security.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				These are things that a shockingly vast majority of us do not care about, have not been
				exposed to, or simply take for granted. "Oh, somebody else will surely take care of them. My
				job is to write code, fast." Sorry to disappoint: that somebody is you.
