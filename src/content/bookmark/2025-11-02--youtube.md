Another problem with humanoid robots is that they take creativity and fun out of chores. Remember all the times you found ways to make your chores bearable or even enjoyable. Washing dishes? It’s the perfect time to catch up with a friend over phone. Ironing clothes? The perfect time to reflect on a difficult problem. Cleaning your house? The perfect time to rearrange things and get rid of stuff so there’s less to clean.
