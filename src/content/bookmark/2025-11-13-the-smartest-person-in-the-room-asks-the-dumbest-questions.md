As an engineering manager, fishing for clarity through ‘dumb’ questions is such an important skill in fleshing out complex projects. Ironically, de-risking projects leads to de-risking career, not the other way around. So, if you've been nodding along and playing it safe on encountering ambiguous terms/requirements, remember the instances when that project was delayed or caused panic. What's riskier - blowing projects or appearing 'dumb'?
