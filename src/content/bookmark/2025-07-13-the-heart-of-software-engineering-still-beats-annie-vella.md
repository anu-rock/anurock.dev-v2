excerpt: "A few weeks ago, I had a conversation that’s stayed with me. A colleague from another department said: “I’ve always been able to read and understand code, even debug it, but I could never write it.”
Something about this revelation stayed with me. Most people I’ve met outside the software engineering world tend to describe code as unintelligible - like hieroglyphics. I guess that’s why I’ve always assumed: if someone couldn’t write code, they probably couldn’t read it either."

Annie provides a good mental model to work with AI coding assistants without losing the soul of software engineering.
