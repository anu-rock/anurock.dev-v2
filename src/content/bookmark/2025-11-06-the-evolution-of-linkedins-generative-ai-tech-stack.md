Other than illustrating LinkedIn's GenAI adoption journey, the article reinforces my belief in the notion that we should stop regarding AI as a massive job terminator. It's a tool, just like any other, to supercharge one's abilities and help move faster. A good case study on cleverly aligning new bolder initiatives with tech debt management, refactoring systems incrementally, and upskilling via pair programming. Personal take (🌶️): Despite the fancy system design, LinkedIn's AI features for candidates feel average at best.
