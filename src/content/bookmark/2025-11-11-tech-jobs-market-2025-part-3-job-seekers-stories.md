Confirms all my instincts about the current job market 😓 Higher demand for backend engineers. Pure frontend roles no longer a thing. Zero tolerance attitude by employers who are no longer willing to bet on potential. Infra & SRE roles high in demand. Staff-level expectations from engineering managers. Pedigree (stamp of big tech or top university) matters disproportionately more than real experience. AI-native skills are an unstated expectation. Can't get grimmer than this, can it?
