My key takeaway comes from the last part. Start small to build influence. Identify a small pain point and create content to fix it (RFC, code, presentation). Then use your earned trust to propose another small, related change. Once you have sufficient influence built from small wins, use it to propose more ambitious changes you always wanted to push.
