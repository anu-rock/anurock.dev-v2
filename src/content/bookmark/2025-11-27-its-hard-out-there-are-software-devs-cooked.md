I respectfully disagree with Wes and Scott's thoughts about the state of frontend engineer role. I DO think pure FE roles are disappearing.

I have personally witnessed leaders in both large and small orgs expecting FE folks to upskill themselves across the full stack (servers, DBs, caches, and whatnot), because LLMs can generate frontends pretty damn well. As for backend engineers, I think it's fair to say they are now expected to pick up stuff that was earlier the dominion of SRE and DevOps folks. Mergers and acquisitions in engineering roles, haha.
